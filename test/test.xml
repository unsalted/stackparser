There are almost certainly numerous things you signed to become a student, as well as various policies you agreed to in first gaining access to the computer services, which would apply here.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I can tell you with certainty that the school where I was a student had a policy that I agreed to that they would make certain information available to other students unless I chose for it to be restricted.  However, my university did not have any photos of students that were viewable by other students in a directory.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That said, there were also times I participated in extra-curricular activities where I was required to sign release forms giving the school the rights to video tape, record, and photograph me, and to do what they wished with those things.  So, with that in mind, I suspect that's partly due to FERPA restrictions, but also largely due to their own privacy policies that go beyond what FERPA requires.  All in all, I doubt they would be okay with you using their photos for your own private use - student privacy is something that is taken very seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="18" LastActivityDate="2015-05-26T21:30:52.027" CommentCount="1" />

A DNR order proper is an order issued by a medical practitioner (at least in Maryland, this is a doctor, an APRN, or a physician's assistant), and has to take an extremely specific form (either a specific state-issued form, or a specific state-issued device like a bracelet). A &quot;DNR&quot; shirt can't serve as a DNR order, and so EMS will ignore it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;With physicians, it's more complicated -- they have to obey your wishes whether or not you filled out the state form, and so if you clearly express a wish not to be resuscitated they will issue a DNR order. However, they can't do this unless it's clear that you're giving informed consent to the order; wearing a shirt isn't considered to show that you made an informed decision that you intended to be binding. An advance directive (specifying what care you'll want if you aren't conscious, which is the only time a DNR applies anyway) will require some way to confirm that this is really what you intend; generally, this consists of a (witnessed) signature or oral instructions to a practitioner.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="37" LastActivityDate="2015-05-27T00:41:53.103" CommentCount="4" />

First off, there is no&#xA;  department or process within the U.S. government to regulate martial&#xA;  arts, which means there is no instrument in place to identify persons&#xA;  practicing fighting arts, and no governmental method by which&#xA;  practitioners can be evaluated. ... &#xA;  Actually there is not a country on earth where martial artists are&#xA;  required to register themselves as weapons, deadly or otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;This myth has its roots in two different aspects of mid-20th century&#xA;  history. In post-World War II Japan traditional martial arts were made&#xA;  illegal, and records were kept of those persons who were experienced&#xA;  practitioners of the arts. This was a bit of anti-Japanese backlash&#xA;  following the war and lasted only a few years. It has not been&#xA;  repeated, and it never spread beyond the borders of Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;The other root is planted in the soil of the rich and often outrageous&#xA;  history of professional boxing. In the Joe Lewis era (the boxer, not&#xA;  the karate master), it was a common publicity stunt to have police on&#xA;  hand during a press conference to “register” the boxer as a deadly&#xA;  weapon. Understand, this was just a publicity stunt and carried no&#xA;  more legal weight than receiving the Key to the City actually means&#xA;  you can open any door with it and just walk in.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;  &#xA;  &lt;p&gt;In court cases involving violent confrontations, lawyers and judges&#xA;  may advise the jury to bear in mind a person’s martial arts, boxing,&#xA;  or military combat training when evaluating the facts of the case. For&#xA;  example, in the Matter of the Welfare of D.S.F., 416 N.W.2d 772 (Minn.&#xA;  App. 1988), the Minnesota Court of Appeals concluded that the&#xA;  defendant, who had &quot;substantial experience in karate,&quot; was aware&#xA;  enough of the potential of his blows to deliberately break the&#xA;  plaintiff’s jaw. But that is a lot different from legally stating that&#xA;  the person in question is a registered or licensed “deadly weapon”.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;" OwnerUserId="10" LastActivityDate="2015-05-27T03:10:10.160" CommentCount="7" />

To sum up the discussion, because of O.Reg 615 of the French Language Services Act, there is a possibility that you can challenge uniligual signs in French service regions like Toronto. The reality is, Toronto never adopted the option to make all traffic signs bilingual. Quoting someone who posted in the forum who tried to challenge a sign without french and lost the case:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&quot;...the prosecutor argued that City of Toronto never approval or adopted&#xA;  this bilingual option. He further mentioned that the City has appealed&#xA;  and won the case from the superior court.&quot;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the Highway Traffic Act:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt;&#xA;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ontario.ca/laws/regulation/900615/v1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;HTA OREG 615&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&#xA;  52. A municipality situated in an area designated by the French Language Services Act is not required to comply with the sign&#xA;  requirements for such areas unless it (Municipality) has passed a&#xA;  by-law under section 14 of that Act. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the answer appears to be &lt;strong&gt;yes, you have to obey English-only signs in Toronto&lt;/strong&gt;. You may be able to challenge signs in other areas of Ontario, but only if a municipality has passed a by-law under section 14 of the French Language Services Act.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, you have to obey all posted signs. Depending on the region, you could make an argument that the sign must be updated to include french, but it is unlikely you could argue that you were not required to obey it in most places. &lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Canada is bilingual at the federal level, so all &lt;em&gt;federal&lt;/em&gt; services must make their signs bilingual, but &lt;strong&gt;the provinces of Canada are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; all bilingual&lt;/strong&gt;. The laws will change from province to province, Quebec for example is technically unilingual French, so they are not required to put english on their signs, but regardless of which province you are in, you must obey all posted signs.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a number of provinces that are unilingual English, I grew up in British Columbia, there aren't any French or bilingual signs out here except for in National Parks and on government buildings. I couldn't carry a conversation in French if my life depended on it, not many people out here could, and the ones that can mostly moved here from Quebec.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ontario has the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Language_Services_Act&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;French Language Services Act&lt;/a&gt;, which requires all government services (not just federal) to be offered in french if the francophone population meets a certain threshold. The areas in blue in the image below represent areas that provide french services, the dark blue indicates that the entire region is required to offer french services, the light blue indicate areas that have communities that offer french services.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;http://i.stack.imgur.com/msdfq.png&quot; alt=&quot;enter image description here&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Toronto is a designated french services municipality, &lt;s&gt;so technically, the sign probably &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; be bilingual,&lt;/s&gt; but the fact that it is not &lt;em&gt;does not&lt;/em&gt; give you justification to break the law.
